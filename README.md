# What is Affogato
Well it's üç¶ + ‚òï, which are all the things im going to need after writing all of this. Other than that though, it's a personal math project I use inspired by a variety of different math libraries.
# What it contains
The library is mainly filled with a bunch of things I needed at the time. As I made more projects, more math code was added.
## Linear Algebra
The largest portion of this library is filled with code for vectors and matrices, in fact it's one of the first things I ever needed, and has been left relatively unchanged.
* Vectors
  * Coordinate representation
  * Polar Coordinates
* Matrices
## Geometry
* Segments
* Rays
* Hyperecubes
  * Rectangles
  * Cubes (Cuboid)
* Spheres
* Triangles
## Spatial Curves
* Z-curve (Morton codes)
## Smoothing Functions
* Smooth interpolation
* Linear interpolation
* Bilinear interpolation
## Algebra
* Complex numbers
* Quaternions
* Formulas
  * Quadratic Formula
  * Cubic Formula
# Things I might add
* I've been interested in geometric algebra, so I might look into ganja.js and add rotors. This might lead to an enire rework of Complex numbers and Quaternions, as well as the addition of hyperbolic numbers (Split complex numbers) and duel numbers, although I currently have no reason to, as it's not something im working on for a project.
# Inspirations
* [glm](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLM/) (OpenGL Mathematics) possibly one of my biggest inspirations, Lots of the Matrix and Vector code is inspired from this library.
* [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen/tree/master) A smaller but equally important inspiration, from which I derived my Segment code.
* [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#addingasphere) The Ray class is inspired from this site
