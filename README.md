# What is Affogato
Well it's üç¶ + ‚òï, which are all the things im going to need after writing all of this. Other than that though, it's a personal math project I use inspired by a variety of different math libraries.
# Inspirations
* [glm](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLM/) (OpenGL Mathematics) possibly one of my biggest inspirations, Lots of the Matrix and Vector code is inspired from this library.
* [msdfgen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen/tree/master) A smaller but equally important inspiration, from which I derived my Segment code.
